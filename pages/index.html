		<p>Rutejìmo wanted nothing more than to be the clan's greatest warrior. He dreamed of sprinting across the desert faster than a horse or using sunlight as a weapon against the clans of the night.</p>
		
		<p>When he and four others were left in the middle of the desert by Rutejìmo's own brother, it was his fiercest rival that rose as the warrior of legend. She could outrun, outfight, and use magic he couldn't even hope of wielding.</p>

		<p>Torn by guilt and struggling with his jealousy, Rutejìmo abandoned her and a seriously-injured boy to begin the long trek back home with the other two teenagers. But, the path he took would send him down a path that would strip away everything he thought he was and reveal the man he had become. Along the way, he will sacrifice everything for his clan, fight an assassin of the night, and offer his throat to the warrior who stole his dreams.</p>

		<p>Sand and Blood <em>is the first of three novels exploring Rutejìmo's life. It is a harrowing tale of self-discovery and Rutejìmo's search to find his place among friends, his clan, and the brutal world of the desert. It is set in the rich world where the only way to learn magic is to risk death and where death comes in the dark of the night.</em></p>

		<p>D. Moonfire is the remarkable result from the intersection of a computer nerd, a scientist, and polymath. Instead of focusing on a single genre, he writes stories and novels in many different settings ranging from fantasy to science fiction. He also throws in the occasional romance or forensics murder mystery to mix things up.</p>
